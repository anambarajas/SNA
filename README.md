A cellular learning automata-based algorithm for community detection in a research network in Colombia

This research project was conducted between May 2019 and May 2020 in Colombia. This project is in the area of data mining and it's the thesis of two undergraduate students from Universidad Industrial de Santander. Attached you will find the code of a cellular learning automata-based algorithm used to reveal the community structure in an Industrial Engineering research network in Colombia. The data was provided in case someone wishes to run the algorithm and understand how it works. As this thesis was presented in a Spanish-speaking country the code was commented in Spanish and some of the variables were named in Spanish.
